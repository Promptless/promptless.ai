# Promptless Website (promptless.ai)

Astro + Starlight site. Deployed to Vercel. Migrated onto the Promptless
[Starport template](https://github.com/Promptless/starport-template); the
`.starport-template.json` marker at the repo root records which template version
this site is on. Never delete it — Promptless reads it to run managed migrations.
See [`CUSTOMIZE.md`](CUSTOMIZE.md) for where to change what, and [`adrs/`](adrs/)
for architecture decisions (MADR format).

## Documentation Map

Maintain a map of every file in `docs/` here. When you add, remove, or rename
a file in `docs/`, update this map.

```

+-- analytics.md        # PostHog setup, event catalog, tracking gaps and recommendations
+-- events.md           # Marketing event glossary: canonical reference for every PostHog event
+-- content_strategy/   # Audience/persona/CUJ/IA strategy (see "Docs & Audience Strategy" below)

## Key Conventions

- **Analytics**: Use `data-track-action`, `data-track-funnel`, `data-track-location`,
  `data-track-campaign` attributes on clickable elements. See `docs/analytics.md`
  for the event catalog and naming conventions.
- **Content**: Marketing pages use content collections in `src/content/website/`.
  Docs live in `src/content/docs/`. Blog in `src/content/blog/`.
- **Redirects**: Defined in `astro.config.mjs` (static) merged with
  `src/lib/generated/redirects.json`. `redirects.json` is hand-maintained (the
  manifest script never writes it), so add redirect entries for moved or renamed
  pages by hand.
- **Sidebar**: The docs nav is **directory-driven** (Starport Phase 3, ADR
  0003). `starlight-sidebar-topics` wraps Starlight's native folder
  `autogenerate` in `astro.config.mjs`, walking the `src/content/docs/docs/`
  tree. Placement and visibility still come from each page's `sidebar.order` and
  `sidebar.hidden` frontmatter, and per-page nav text from `sidebar.label`
  (falling back to `title`) — Starlight reads those natively. What changed: the
  section/group labels (`Start Here`, `Connect`, `Get the Most Out`, …) are now
  set **explicitly in the `starlight-sidebar-topics` config**, not derived from
  an index page's frontmatter. There is no generated `sidebar.json` anymore, and
  no `buildSidebar()` step — the old frontmatter→`sidebar.json` pipeline was
  retired. To change nav placement or a page label, edit that page's frontmatter;
  to rename a section/group or reorder groups, edit the topic config in
  `astro.config.mjs`. `scripts/generate-manifest.ts` still runs via
  `generate:manifest` / `prebuild`, but now only produces `route-manifest.json`
  (used by the `.md` endpoints). Phase 5 (ADR 0004 §2) settled the topic model on
  a **single "Documentation" topic** — the OpenAPI `/api/*` pages live inside it,
  and the repo's `Sidebar` override renders the sublist directly, so no
  topic-switcher bar shows. Keep it that way: add new sections to the docs topic's
  `items` rather than creating a second topic, which would surface the switcher
  bar as a user-visible IA change (write an ADR first if that ever becomes intended).

## Commands

```bash
npm install              # install dependencies
npm run dev              # dev server at localhost:4321
npm run build            # production build
npm run check            # typecheck + build
npm run test:smoke       # smoke tests
npm run build:diagrams   # compile src/diagrams/*.mmd → public/mermaid/*.svg
```

## Diagrams

Mermaid diagram sources live in `src/diagrams/*.mmd`. The compiled SVGs in
`public/mermaid/` are committed to the repo and must be rebuilt locally when
a diagram changes — run `npm run build:diagrams` and commit the updated SVG.
This step is intentionally excluded from the production build because it
requires a local Chromium install via `@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`.

Each `.mmd` file supports optional rendering directives in comments at the top:

```
%% mmdc-width: 750
%% mmdc-height: 600
```

## Docs & Audience Strategy

Audience, persona, journey (CUJ), and proposed Docs-tab IA definitions live in
`docs/content_strategy/` (internal; not built into the site). Read the relevant file on demand —
do not inline. Derived from customer/prospect call evidence.

- `docs/content_strategy/README.md` — index + how the IDs link (start here)
- `docs/content_strategy/audiences/` — 6 target segments (`aud-*`), incl. a cross-cutting brownfield segment
- `docs/content_strategy/personas/` — 1 minimal persona per audience (`persona-*`)
- `docs/content_strategy/journeys/` — 16 critical user journeys (`cuj-*`), steps → `/docs/...`
- `docs/content_strategy/information_architecture/` — CUJ-driven Docs-tab IA + gap analysis

When planning docs IA, page types, or content priorities, consult `proposed-ia.md` and
`ia-gap-analysis.md`, and make actual content changes under `src/content/docs/`.
